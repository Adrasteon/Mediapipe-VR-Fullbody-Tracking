# MoveNet-VR-Fullbody-Tracking
A test repository using MoveNet and VideoPose3D for fullbody tracking in VR with a single camera.

This is still a work in progress, not meant to be used yet. Main purpose is for other programmers who may have an interest in such a system.

The bat files are configured to use a local instalation of python in /python, but you can also use the scripts directly. You also need the 2d-3d VideoPose3d model to run this, for which you can message me on discord: my username is juice#6370

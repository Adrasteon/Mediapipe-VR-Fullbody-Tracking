# ML Integration for Learned Improvements and Prediction

This document explores potential ways to integrate machine learning models into the VR tracking application loop for adaptive improvements in accuracy, smoothness, and prediction over time.

## 1. Learned Pose Filtering/Smoothing

*   **Concept:** Replace static filters (like EMA or OneEuroFilter) with a small ML model (e.g., LSTM, GRU, MLP) trained to output a "corrected" or "smoothed" version of the raw `pose3d` data from MediaPipe.
*   **Learning/Feedback:**
    *   **Offline:** Train the model on collected sequences of raw `pose3d` data, using manually smoothed sequences or high-quality offline tracking results as the target output.
    *   **Online (Advanced):** Define a loss function rewarding smoothness (low velocity/acceleration) while penalizing excessive deviation from the raw input. Requires careful tuning.
*   **Pros:** Can potentially adapt to user-specific movement patterns or noise characteristics better than generic filters.
*   **Cons:** Requires training data collection/preparation, adds inference latency, defining "ideal" smoothness is challenging.

## 2. Predictive Tracking (Latency Compensation & Gap Filling)

*   **Concept:** Use a time-series model to predict the *next* pose based on recent history. This prediction can:
    *   Reduce perceived latency by anticipating movement slightly.
    *   Fill short gaps if MediaPipe temporarily loses tracking.
*   **Models:**
    *   **Kalman Filters:** Classic, computationally efficient method for state estimation and prediction, suitable for modeling relatively smooth motion. Libraries like `filterpy` are available.
    *   **Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM/GRU):** Can model more complex, non-linear motion patterns but are computationally heavier and require more data.
*   **Learning/Feedback:** Models learn motion dynamics directly from the sequence of poses provided by MediaPipe.
*   **Pros:** Can improve perceived responsiveness and robustness to minor tracking dropouts.
*   **Cons:** Prediction errors can cause unnatural movements (overshooting, jerky corrections). Adds computational overhead. Requires tuning.

## 3. Adaptive Parameter Tuning

*   **Concept:** Train a model (e.g., using Reinforcement Learning or simpler bandit algorithms) to dynamically adjust parameters like smoothing factors, filter coefficients, or MediaPipe confidence thresholds based on real-time conditions.
*   **Learning/Feedback:** Requires defining a quantifiable "reward" signal indicating tracking quality. Potential metrics include:
    *   Low jitter (variance of keypoint positions).
    *   Consistency of estimated bone lengths.
    *   Average MediaPipe confidence scores.
    *   *(Direct user feedback is generally impractical).*
*   **Pros:** Could automatically optimize settings for varying conditions (lighting, clothing, movement style).
*   **Cons:** Defining a robust reward signal is very difficult. RL can be complex to implement and stabilize.

## Implementation Considerations

*   **Computational Cost:** ML inference adds latency and CPU/GPU load. Models must be lightweight and optimized for real-time use.
*   **Training Data:** Supervised approaches require collecting and potentially labeling/processing relevant data.
*   **Real-time Inference:** Requires an efficient inference engine (e.g., ONNX Runtime, TensorFlow Lite, NumPy for simple models).

## Feasible Starting Point

*   Implementing a **Kalman Filter** for predictive tracking and smoothing is often a practical first step. It's well-established, computationally efficient, and offers tangible benefits without requiring deep learning expertise. It could be applied to the `pose3d` data within the main loop (`mediapipepose.py`).
